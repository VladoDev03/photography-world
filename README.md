# photography-world

## `Short description`
### I am interested in photography and soon I enrolled for a ReactJs course. For the exam I had to develop an front-end application and that is why I decided to buil this app.
### In the app, photographers can upload their pictures as a portfolio or just to share with a friend.
### If a user is a guest, they can view all pictures and user profiles.
### If user has logged in, they can upload pictures and like those of others.
### All CRUD operations can be performed by the owner of the picture.
## `front-end stack`
### ReactJs as main java script library/framework
### react-router-dom for client-side routing
### react-icons for in-app icons
### css and css modules for styling
## `back-end stack`
### Custom REST API with ASP.NET Core as main framework
### EntityFrameWork Core as main ORM provider
